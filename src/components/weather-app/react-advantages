1. Developer experience 

	react dev tools (to monitor: performance, re-renders)

	redux dev tools (time travel debugging - toggle the redux store to view different UI states in real time)

	Active community and support -> blogs/ tutorials/ chat forums

	Hot reload -> components update on state change without reloading the entire page

	Functional programming - code is easier to read and reason about and thus easier to debug

2. Library size

	standalone React & ReactDOM (minified) 6 kb + 97 kb = 103kb

	canjs 2.3 = 134 kb

3. Performace

	ReactJS is based on one-way-data-binding VirtualDOM and is more performant

	CanJS is based on two-way-data-binding using observables
